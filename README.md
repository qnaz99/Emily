# Emily: The Healthcare Finding app

Emily is a hospital tracking system created using React. The main purpose of this project was to practice coding in React, particularly implementing login with Google Authentication as well as creating a functional application from a Figma design. The Figma design used can be found here:

The app is far from complete, the following are next on the to-do list:
-Implement topbar buttons and search 
-Implement Google Authentication throughout all pages in Router 
-Pull profile pictures from Google account
-Fix topbar not displaying correctly on certain pages
-Host website using Github Pages
-Implement Google Maps API
-Replace placeholder images with actual hospital images


There's much more to do before the app is complete but those are my next steps.

The following diagrams were created in plannning and implementing the app
